# CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM :  
We have a bank marketing classification  problem in which we are predicting if the client will subscribe a term deposit . All bank marketing campaigns are dependent on customers huge electronic data. The size of these data sources is impossible for a human analyst to come up with interesting information that will help in the decision-making process. Data mining models are completely helping in the performance of these campaigns and also helps in predicting the best campaign contact with the clients for subscribing deposit.

# REGRESSION PROBLEM : 
Here, we are analyzing the number of shares depending on the attributes and predict if the news will get popular on internet or not from dataset of online news popularity. The dataset is divided into two sets that is training and testing dataset.  This type of analysis is used for the purpose for finding out what elements makes an article or  news popular. Since, social media is a popular way to share news and interesting articles, it is not uncommon for a person to be active on both facebook and twitter to share an article on both platforms. Thus, one measure for popularity of an article could be how many times it has been shared. Thus, an article can be neutral (no shares), unpopular (low shares), popular (high shares) or viral based on how many times it has been shared.

# SOFTWARE USED ORANGE
Orange is an open-source software package released under GPL. Versions up to 3.0 include core components in C++ with wrappers in Python are available on github. From version 3.0 onwards, Orange uses common Python open-source libraries for scientific computing, such as numpy, scipy and scikit-learn, while its graphical user interface operates within the cross-platform Qt framework. Orange3 has a separate github.
The default installation includes a number of machine learning, preprocessing and data visualization algorithms in 6 widget sets (data, visualize, classify, regression, evaluate and unsupervised). Additional functionalities are available as add-ons (bioinformatics, data fusion and text-mining).
Orange is supported on macOS, Windows and Linux and can also be installed from the Python Package Index repository (pip install Orange3).
FEATURES
Orange consists of a canvas interface onto which the user places widgets and creates a data analysis workflow. Widgets offer basic functionalities such as reading the data, showing a data table, selecting features, training predictors, comparing learning algorithms, visualizing data elements, etc. The user can interactively explore visualizations or feed the selected subset into other widgets.

Canvas: graphical front-end for data analysis
Widgets:
   Data: widgets for data input, data filtering, sampling, imputation, feature manipulation and feature selection
   Visualize: widgets for common visualization (box plot, histograms, scatter plot) and multivariate visualization (mosaic display, sieve diagram).
   Classify: a set of supervised machine learning algorithms for classification
   Regression: a set of supervised machine learning algorithms for regression
   Evaluate: cross-validation, sampling-based procedures, reliability estimation and scoring of prediction methods
   Unsupervised: unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering (k-means, hierarchical clustering) and data projection techniques (multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, correspondence analysis).
   Add-ons:
       Associate: widgets for mining frequent item sets and association rule learning
       Bioinformatics: widgets for gene set analysis, enrichment, and access to pathway libraries
       Data fusion: widgets for fusing different data sets, collective matrix factorization, and exploration of latent factors
       Educational: widgets for teaching machine learning concepts, such as k-means clustering, polynomial regression, stochastic gradient descent, ...
       Geo: widgets for working with geospatial data
       Image analytics: widgets for working with images and Image Net embeddings
       Network: widgets for graph and network analysis
       Text mining: widgets for natural language processing and text mining
       Time series: widgets for time series analysis and modeling
